# ABOUT
Flutter-based app that uses Firebase's ML Engine to recognize murals in San Diego's Chicano park. App can be run on iOS and android and the trained model is already included in local code (and can be downloaded later from firebase). The ML engine was trained on roughly 10,000 images that we took in Chicano Park giving it about 80% accuracy. With more pictures this accuracy could be brought up significantly but I'm no longer in San Diego so I can't improve it on my end. 

# WHAT IS CHICANO PARK?
Just because I don't want to butcher the history here's a link with some basic info on the park's origin: https://www.sandiego.org/articles/parks-gardens/chicano-park.aspx
